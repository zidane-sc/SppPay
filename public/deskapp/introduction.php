					<p>DeskApp admin is a popular open source WebApp template for admin dashboards and control panels. DeskApp is fully responsive HTML template, which is based on the CSS framework Bootstrap 4. It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many commonly used plugins to create a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. DeskApp is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and built upon. This documentation will guide you through installing the template and exploring the various components that are bundled with the template.</p>
					<p>We put a lot of love and effort to make DeskApp Admin a useful template for everyone and now It comes with New Ui. We are keen to release continuous long term updates and lots of new features will be coming soon in the future releases</p>
